# A Magic the Gathering Damage Calculator

To help myself and my MtG group learn the game I made this damage calculator. I also wanted something to practice some coding on as I hadn't done any in a long time and was starting to feel rusty. Will most likely update this with more things as I understand the game better and improve some skills.

[Test it for yourself](https://haakmal.github.io/mtg-calculator) and if you use it in your games give me a [shout](https://twitter.com/haideraliakmal)!

# How to use

Go to the [live page](https://haakmal.github.io/mtg-calculator) and enter in the stats for your *Attacker* and *Blocker* cards. Select any attributes that apply like *First Strike*, *Deathtouch*, etc, and hit the Battle button!

## What can this calculator do

~~Not much at the moment but I'm planning things ahead for practice.~~ Almost everything I had planned with a few things left :bowtie:

- [x] Calculate damage
- [ ] Apply First Strike [^3]
- [ ] Apply Double Strike [^3]
- [x] Apply Deathtouch
- [x] Apply Lifelink
- [x] Apply Indestructible
- [x] Apply Cannot Block
- [ ] Apply Trample [^4]
- [ ] Apply Flying [^4]
- [ ] Apply Reach [^4]
- [ ] Calculate if Planeswalker [^4]
- [ ] Explain calculation[^1]
- [ ] Calculate any counters[^2]

[^1]: Been trying to implement this but it may just be too much for me right now
[^2]: Might be scrapped in the end
[^3]: Still working on this
[^4]: Added new features
