# A Magic the Gathering Damage Calculator

To help myself and my MtG group learn the game I made this damage calculator. I wanted something to practice some coding one as I hadn't done any in a long time and was starting to feel I was getting rusty. Will most likely update this with more things as I understand the game better.

[Test it for yourself](https://haideraliakmal.github.io/mtg-calculator) and if you use it in your games give me a [shout](https://twitter.com/haideraliakmal)!

# How to use it

Go to the [live page](https://haideraliakmal.github.io/mtg-calculator) and enter in the stats for your *Attacker* and *Blocker* cards. Select any attributes that apply like *First Strike*, *Deathtouch*, etc, and hit the Battle button!

## What can this calculator do

Also what I'm planning to add ahead for practice.

- [x] Calculate damage
- [ ] Apply First Strike
- [ ] Apply Double Strike
- [ ] Apply Deathtouch
- [ ] Apply Lifelink
- [ ] Show some flavour text
- [ ] Calculate any counters

**PS.** I'm still working on this and my coding skills aren't the best so if anyone wants to fork this and improve it feel free!
